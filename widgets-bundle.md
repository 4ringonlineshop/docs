# Widgets bundle developer docs

The SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle is far more than just a collection of widgets. It's a framework that you can build on to create widgets in minimal time. It features powerful form building, data handling and templating. The core of the Widgets Bundle handles everything for you, so you can focus your efforts on building beautiful widgets.

Even if you wont want to create your own widgets from scratch, the Widgets Bundle is easy to extend in other ways. You can create custom templates, styles and form fields for all our existing widgets. One example use case is creating a custom style for the button widget that fits in with the look and feel of your theme.

These developer docs will teach you everything you need to know to build on top of the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle.
