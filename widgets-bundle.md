# Widgets bundle developer docs

The widgets bundle is a convenient collection of widgets, bundled as a plugin. It also happens to be an excellent framework for creating new widgets with minimal coding required. Here we explain how to extend the widgets bundle with your own widgets. If you've done so in a fork of our git repository, you can even submit a pull request and your widget might be included in the official bundle.
