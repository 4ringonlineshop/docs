# Adding custom fields

**Please Note:** The old method we implemented for adding custom fields was undocumented and had some flaws. We're working on a new [object orientated approach](https://github.com/siteorigin/so-widgets-bundle/tree/feature/class-fields) approach to implementing fields both within the Widgets Bundle base itself and for 3rd party plugins.

We highly recommend you wait for the new method to be available if you're planning on adding fields. For now, you can suggest any fields you'd like to see on the Widgets Bundle [Github page](https://github.com/siteorigin/so-widgets-bundle/issues).
